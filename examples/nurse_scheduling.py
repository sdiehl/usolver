Nurse Scheduling Optimization Example

This module demonstrates staff scheduling optimization for a hospital nursing department.
The problem involves assigning nurses to shifts across multiple days while satisfying
operational requirements and work-life balance constraints.

The constraint programming problem assigns nurses to shifts subject to:
- Each shift must be assigned to exactly one nurse each day
- Each nurse works at most one shift per day
- Workload distribution: each nurse works 2-3 shifts over the period
- Special constraints (e.g., certain nurses unavailable on specific days)
- Minimum staffing requirements per shift type

This is a classic constraint satisfaction problem suitable for OR-Tools CP-SAT.
