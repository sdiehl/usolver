Optimize a distillation column design to minimize total annual cost while meeting product purity specifications.

**Feed:** 

* 100 kmol/h Component A (light, volatile)
* 60 kmol/h Component B (heavy, less volatile)
* 80°C, 1.5 bar

The design variables to optimize are:

1. **Number_of_Trays** (N): Integer between 10-50 trays
2. **Reflux_Ratio** (RR): Real number between 0.5-5.0
3. **Feed_Tray_Location** (NF): Integer between 5 and min(45, N-5) (tray number from bottom)
4. **Column_Diameter** (D): Real number between 0.8-3.0 meters

The constraints are:

1. Product Purity Requirements

- Distillate purity of Component A: x_A_dist ≥ 0.95 (at least 95% pure)
- Bottoms purity of Component B: x_B_bot ≥ 0.90 (at least 90% pure)

2. Operating Constraints

- Maximum pressure drop across column: ΔP ≤ 5.0 kPa
- Minimum tray efficiency: η ≥ 0.60
- Maximum vapor velocity (flooding constraint): v_vapor ≤ 2.5 m/s
- Feed tray location must be between 5 and min(45, N-5) (not too close to ends)

3. Mass Balance Constraints

- Total material balance: F = D + B (Feed = Distillate + Bottoms)
- Component A balance: F × z_A = D × x_A_dist + B × x_A_bot
- Component B balance: F × z_B = D × x_B_dist + B × x_B_bot
- Feed composition: z_A = 100/160 = 0.625, z_B = 60/160 = 0.375
- Reflux relationship: L = RR × D (where L is liquid reflux)

4. Physical Constraints

- Minimum reflux ratio constraint: RR ≥ RR_min (typically 1.2 × minimum theoretical)
- Column diameter sizing based on vapor flow: D ≥ sqrt(4×V_vapor/(π×v_max×ρ_vapor)) 
- Tray spacing and column height: H = N × tray_spacing (assume 0.6 m per tray)
- Vapor density approximation: ρ_vapor ≈ 2.0 kg/m³ (at operating conditions)

5. Utility Constraints

- Maximum steam flow for reboiler: Steam ≤ 500 kg/h
- Maximum cooling water flow for condenser: CW ≤ 10,000 kg/h

The objective function is to minimize total annual cost:

Total_Cost = Capital_Cost + Operating_Cost

Where:
- **Capital_Cost** = Column_Cost + Tray_Cost
  - Column_Cost = 5000 × H ($/m of height)
  - Tray_Cost = 1500 × N ($/tray)

- **Operating_Cost** = Steam_Cost + Cooling_Water_Cost
  - Steam_Cost = 0.02 × Steam_Flow × 8760 ($/year)
  - Cooling_Water_Cost = 0.001 × CW_Flow × 8760 ($/year)

For this binary distillation optimization, use these approximations:

1. **Minimum trays** (Fenske equation): N_min = log((x_A_dist/(1-x_A_dist)) × ((1-x_A_bot)/x_A_bot)) / log(α_AB)
   - Assume relative volatility α_AB = 2.5 (Component A relative to Component B)

2. **Minimum reflux ratio** (Underwood method): RR_min = (x_A_dist - x_A_feed)/(x_A_feed - x_A_bot)
   - Where x_A_feed = z_A = 0.625 (liquid composition of A in feed)

3. **Vapor flow rate**: V = D × (RR + 1) (kmol/h)

4. **Steam requirement**: Steam ≈ 2.0 × B × MW_avg (kg/h, where MW_avg ≈ 50 kg/kmol)

5. **Cooling water requirement**: CW ≈ 12 × D × MW_avg (kg/h)

6. **Component recovery constraints**:
   - Recovery of A in distillate: R_A = (D × x_A_dist)/(F × z_A) ≥ 0.90
   - Recovery of B in bottoms: R_B = (B × x_B_bot)/(F × z_B) ≥ 0.85

Solve this optimization problem and provide:

1. Optimal values for all design variables
2. Verification that all constraints are satisfied
3. Total annual cost breakdown
4. Key performance metrics (recovery rates, energy consumption)
5. Material balance verification for both components
